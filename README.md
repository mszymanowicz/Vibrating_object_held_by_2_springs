# Vibrating_object_held_by_2_springs
A bob weighing *M* is held by 2 non-linear springs characterized by *k<sub>1</sub>\[N/m\]* and *k<sub>2</sub>\[N/m<sup>2</sup>\]* constants. There are 3 forces applied to the bob: gravitational force and 2 non-linear forces generated by the springs. Friction, damping and other resistances to motion are ignored. The bob can move only vertically in one dimension and starts at z=0, t=0.

The purpose of this project is to calculate *z[m]* coordinate of the bob and its velocity *v<sub>z</sub>[m/s]* every 0.01s. Total time of the bob movement analysis is hardcoded as *t<sub>k</sub>=60s*. These parameters are calculated using numerical Runge-Kutta RK4 method of solving differential equations. RK4 procedure is written from scratch and is not dependent on numerical libraries.

What is more, kinetic and potential energies of the bob are calculated in every iteration of the program and then added to prove that the total energy of the bob is constant.

*a*, *k<sub>1</sub>*, *k<sub>2</sub>*, *M* parameters of the system are defined by the user at the start of the program. The results are written to 'data.txt' file e.g. for their later use and ease of data manipulation in Excel. The program contains MS specific secure versions of functions such as scanf_s() instead of scanf() that appeased older versions of Visual Studio.

The code and results were reviewed by university professor and the project got the highest possible mark.
